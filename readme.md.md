### 🚀 **Rust-Based Firewall & Network Monitor**

A **Rust-based firewall and network monitor** is a **high-performance**, **privacy-focused**, and **cross-platform** tool that helps users monitor, analyze, and secure their internet traffic in **real-time**.

---

## **🔍 Project Overview**

This project is a **real-time network monitor & firewall** that: ✅ **Monitors** all incoming/outgoing network traffic.  
✅ **Blocks** suspicious connections, ads, and trackers.  
✅ **Detects malware, unauthorized access, and DDoS attacks**.  
✅ **Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS**.  
✅ Uses **Rust for speed, security, and low resource consumption**.

## **🔨 Tech Stack**

|Component|Technology|
|---|---|
|**Language**|Rust|
|**Packet Filtering**|eBPF (Linux) / WinDivert (Windows)|
|**Packet Sniffing**|pcap (libpcap for Linux/macOS, WinPcap for Windows)|
|**Network Analysis**|Rust crates like `netlink-packet`, `tokio`, and `pcap`|
|**User Interface**|CLI (TUI) & Web-based dashboard (Tauri / Next.js)|
|**Database (Optional)**|SQLite / RocksDB for storing logs|

## **🛠 Core Features**

### 🔹 **1. Real-time Network Monitoring**

- Displays all **incoming & outgoing traffic** (like `netstat` or `Wireshark`).
- Shows **IP, Protocol, Data Size, and Connection Time**.
- Captures **packet logs** for security analysis.

### 🔹 **2. Firewall Rules & Traffic Blocking**

- Blocks **suspicious IPs**, trackers, and ads.
- Custom **rules to block/unblock specific ports & domains**.
- Detects and prevents **unauthorized access**.

### 🔹 **3. Malware & Threat Detection**

- Uses **signature-based detection** to find malicious packets.
- Identifies **DDoS attempts, port scanning, and brute-force attacks**.
- Supports **IP reputation databases** (block known bad IPs).

### 🔹 **4. Bandwidth Monitoring & Limits**

- Tracks **which apps use the most bandwidth**.
- Users can set **limits for network usage**.
- Prevents **excessive data consumption**.

### 🔹 **5. Cross-Platform Support**

- **Linux** → Uses **eBPF** (for kernel-level packet filtering).
- **Windows** → Uses **WinDivert** (for deep packet inspection).
- **macOS** → Uses **libpcap** (for network packet capture).

### 🔹 **6. User Interface (CLI & Web Dashboard)**

- **CLI Mode:** TUI (Text-based UI) for fast monitoring.
- **Web UI:** Web-based dashboard using **Tauri + Next.js**.

## **⚙️ How It Works**

1️⃣ **Packet Capture** → Uses **pcap** to intercept network packets.  
2️⃣ **Analysis & Logging** → Checks **packet metadata** (source, destination, size).  
3️⃣ **Firewall Filtering** → Blocks or allows traffic based on **custom rules**.  
4️⃣ **Alert System** → Notifies users of **suspicious activity**.

## **📌 Development Roadmap**

### **📌 Phase 1: Basic Network Sniffer (Rust)**

- [ ]  Use **pcap crate** to capture packets.
- [ ]  Show **source/destination IP, protocol, and data size**.

### **📌 Phase 2: Real-time Monitoring**

- [ ]  Implement **live network traffic view**.
- [ ]  Show **active connections, DNS queries, and HTTP requests**.

### **📌 Phase 3: Packet Filtering (Firewall)**

- [ ]  Allow **custom rules to block/unblock traffic**.
- [ ]  Implement **port filtering & IP blocking**.

### **📌 Phase 4: Malware Detection & Threat Prevention**

- [ ]  Check **known malicious IPs** (threat intelligence).
- [ ]  Detect **DDoS, brute-force attacks, and suspicious patterns**.

### **📌 Phase 5: Web-Based UI**

- [ ]  Create **a Tauri-powered Web UI**.
- [ ]  Allow **rule management & real-time monitoring from a browser**.

## **🚀 Why This Project is Useful**

✅ **Protects users from hackers & malware.**  
✅ **Better privacy control (blocks ads & trackers).**  
✅ **Uses Rust, making it fast & secure.**  
✅ **Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS.**

## **🔥 Next Steps**

1️⃣ **Do you want a CLI or Web-based UI first?**

- CLI first (TUI)?
- Or build a **Next.js + Tauri UI** from the start?

2️⃣ **Do you want firewall rules based on signatures or custom rules?**

- Should we support **blocklists (malicious IPs, ads, trackers)?**

3️⃣ **Do you want real-time alerts for threats?**

- Example: **Popup alerts, email notifications?**
